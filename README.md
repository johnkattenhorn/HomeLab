# HomeLab

This repository contains scripts and documentation for my HomeLab builds. My setup is greatly inspired by the work of Brandon Hopkins, also known as TechHut. You can find his content on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechHutTV) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TechHut?themeRefresh=1).
